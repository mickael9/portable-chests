## Portable chests

This mod adds portable variants to the vanilla chests.

Portable chests have the following properties:

 - can be carried like normal items
 - can be placed and mined
 - inventory accessible by right-clicking on them (when in item form)
 - can be renamed (but the label will be lost if they're placed)
 - can be dropped on the ground (the label stays)
 - can contain other portable chests (unlimited storage, but they're not cheap)
 - can't be mined or placed by robots
